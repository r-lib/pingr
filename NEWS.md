# pingr 2.0.2

* `pingr::ping()` now works better in a non-English locale (#18).

# pingr 2.0.1

* `is_online()` now tries the Apple captive test first, because it works better

  [@pekkarr](https://github.com/pekkarr) (#18).

  of an ICMP ping via an external ping program.

* Now `ip_up()` checks first if the computer is connected to the
  internet, via `is_online()`.

# pingr 1.2.0

* New `is_up()` function to check if a web (other other TCP) server is up.

* New `is_online()` function to check if the computer is online, by
